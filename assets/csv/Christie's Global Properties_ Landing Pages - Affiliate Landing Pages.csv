Massive smooth ash gray boulders of varying sizes rise from the sea's crystalline waters, making a maze of sorts for travelers to wade or swim through. Climbing through the crevices and grottoes of The Baths isn't terribly intensive, but the granite boulders can be slippery so swim shoes or sneakers are encouraged. Once you reach Devil's Bay, the stunning beach clearing at the end of the rocks, you'll find shallow clear waters perfect for a little light snorkeling or restful sunbathing. Visitors are consistent in their praise of The Baths, calling the natural wonder ""beautiful"" and the beach ""pristine.""

You can spot the ship's bow from the surface of the sea, but you'll have to dive some 90 feet down to explore the rest of the largely intact vessel and swim among the moray eels, turtles and octopus that now call the ship home.
